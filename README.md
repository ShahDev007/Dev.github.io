# Awesome Data Science Hub Dataset:-
**NYC Taxi Data:-** This data visualizes 170 million trips from the taxis driven in New York in 2013. In this dataset, data were queried for 30 cab/days. The data was provided by the Taxi And Limousine Commission via a FOIL request. The main reason is to analyze the cont of taxes, fares over an entire time of the day, and when/how taxis went around NewYork. It includes the start and end location of each trip.

**Interpretation:-** From this dataset we can analyze the trips of each taxi(30 taxes) for the year-time. We can examine where the taxis are driven the most, which areas resident needs the most taxes, what is the average distance covered by the taxis, how much average fare is associated to the rides, how much an average person is spending on the rides for a year, how the spending is compared to the people that has cars?

I am very excited to read this book, as it focuses on visualizations developed using D3 library. I have worked on this library for quite a while and it's been amazing experience to develop charts using this library. It also asks for statistical knowledge to develop this library. In my current internship, I have to visualize the data for the usage of each battery and it's temoeratures datapoint. I have developed those charts using D3 library. I am very happy to find this book and will read it as soon as possible.
